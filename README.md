## **Game Description**

### Come embark in this underwater adventure! Channel your inner eel and search for food through the harsh river without getting hurt. Making just one wrong turn can end the entire game, so be careful!

***

## **Getting Started**

### This game will require a board that an evergrowing object can move around. The board must contain walls that the object cannot hit or else will result in a loss. The object can also not run into itself. In order to score points, the object must collect items that will be displayed on the page. Game must contain a home screen and a restart button.
